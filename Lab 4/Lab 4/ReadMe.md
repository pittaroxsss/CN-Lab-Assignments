## Introduction

**IP Addressing and Subnetting** are critical concepts in network design and administration. **Variable Length Subnet Mask (VLSM)** allows efficient utilization of IP address space by varying the subnet mask length. This project demonstrates how to:
- Plan IP Address allocation using VLSM.
- Configure subnetting on Cisco routers.
- Simulate these scenarios in Cisco Packet Tracer.


## Project Features

- **Subnetting & VLSM**: Includes examples and scenarios that implement VLSM.
- **Router Configuration**: Configuring routers with appropriate IP addressing and subnet masks.
- **Ping Testing**: Verifying connectivity between different subnets.
- **Routing**: Static and dynamic routing examples for the subnets created.

## How to Use
